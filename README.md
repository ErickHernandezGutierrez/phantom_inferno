# phantom_inferno
Reimplementation in Python of the ISBI 2012 - HARDI Reconstruction Workshop Phantom

This implementation includes the original phantom structures, but now they are not hard coded.
Besides, more features are added like dispersion and acceleration using vectorial operations.
A whole study folder with different subjects can be generated using a single command line.

Many scripts to run a tractometry pipeline are added.
